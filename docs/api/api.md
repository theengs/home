## Sample API Usage

Here's an example showing how raw data can be transformed into a more understandable format:

**Raw Data**

```json
{
  "id":"88:22:44:44:11:44",
  "rssi":-85,
  "servicedata":"08094411444422880104e500c6020702aa2702012d",
  "servicedatauuid":"0xfdcd"
}
```
**Decoded Data**
```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "88:22:44:44:11:44",
    "rssi": -85,
    "servicedata": "08094411444422880104e500c6020702aa2702012d",
    "servicedatauuid": "0xfdcd",
    "brand": "ClearSensor",
    "model": "Weather Station",
    "model_id": "CXY1W",
    "type": "THBX",
    "tempc": 22.9,
    "tempf": 73.22,
    "hum": 71,
    "pres": 1015.4
  },
  "properties": {
    "properties": {
      "pres": {
        "unit": "hPa",
        "name": "pressure"
      },
      "tempc": {
        "unit": "Â°C",
        "name": "temperature"
      },
      "hum": {
        "unit": "%",
        "name": "humidity"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Try it
Do a post request to https://api.theengs.io/decoder with a json body like the example below:
```json
{
  "id": "55:99:EE:FF:33:88",
  "servicedata": "70000a01090216dd99225598eeff3388",
  "servicedatauuid": "0xfeab"
}
```
You will receive the decoded result with properties and device values.

Alternatively you can also test your raw json into our [Theengs Web Parser](https://parser.theengs.io)

::: tip
The test API is throttled per default, if you would like to have an API key to remove the API limitations see below.
