Theengs ecosystem can be used for analytics, research, or study use cases. Its flexibility enables a great choice of component combinations and usages, with the capability to measure temperature, humidity, moisture, luminance, weight, pressure, fine particles, and more. The possibilities of scientific exploration are numerous.

Because Theengs uses MQTT and has access to a wide range of connectors, it is easy to integrate with scientific and analytic technology stacks.

:::tip What you need
A [BLE sensor](https://decoder.theengs.io/devices/devices_by_brand.html) depending on your use cases + [OpenMQTTGateway](https://docs.openmqttgateway.com) OR [Theengs Gateway](https://gateway.theengs.io), an MQTT broker, [Node Red](https://nodered.org/), a database like [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/) , and an observability platform [Grafana](https://grafana.com/).
Alternatively, many software offer [MQTT connectors](https://github.com/hobbyquaker/awesome-mqtt). 

If you want to access real-time data directly from the sensors without a controller and broker, you can also use the [Theengs App](https://app.theengs.io)

### Environmental Monitoring
BLE sensors can monitor environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, and air quality in research labs, test buildings, and other university facilities. Researchers can collect data over time to identify trends and patterns and use this information for their studies.

### Motion and Vibration Sensing
BLE sensors can detect motion and vibration in various research applications, such as monitoring the movement of laboratory equipment, measuring the performance of mechanical systems, or studying the behavior of living organisms.

### Healthcare and Biomedical Research
BLE sensors can be used in healthcare and biomedical research to collect data on vital signs, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate. This information can be used to monitor patients' health, identify potential health risks, and track the effectiveness of treatments.

### Energy Management
BLE sensors can be used to monitor energy consumption in university test facilities, enabling researchers to analyze the impact of factors such as isolation, AC systems, and house configuration. By collecting and analyzing data over time, researchers can identify areas for energy efficiency improvements and make informed decisions about energy management and sustainability initiatives.
